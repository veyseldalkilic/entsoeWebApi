    - 6.1.E Year-ahead Total Load Forecast
    description: "# &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#9757; /api<s>/6.1.E</s>    \n A year-ahead forecast of the total load per bidding zone for the following year, for every week of the coming year Y maximum and minimum load values. The primary owners of the data are TSOs and DSOs;\n\n This shall be published at the latest the 15th calendar day of the month just before the rolling year which data refers to. The week with the first Thursday in the year is considered as Week Number 1 in the year (ISO 8601).\n\n Nevertheless, the forecast of load for the following year is based on historical load values. A more detailed forecast is provided later, when precise weather forecast (weekly, daily) is available. It may, therefore, vary significantly in terms of both shape and level. \n\n Note: The year-ahead forecast is calculated (estimated) on the historic load profile on similar days.\n\n Note 2: Higher resolution is allowed. Highest resolution is MTU. In that case, the maximum and minimum load values for each week will be published. \n\n <b>Example web browser get method (replace &#128071;MYTOKEN with yours)</b> \n\n <a target='_blank' href=\"https://web-api.tp.entsoe.eu/api?securityToken=MYTOKEN&documentType=A65&processType=A33&outBiddingZone_Domain=10YCZ-CEPS-----N&periodStart=202012012300&periodEnd=202012312300\">https://web-api.tp.entsoe.eu/api?securityToken=MYTOKEN&documentType=A65&processType=A33&outBiddingZone_Domain=10YCZ-CEPS-----N&periodStart=202012012300&periodEnd=202012312300</a>"
