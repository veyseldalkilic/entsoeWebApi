    description: "# &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#9757; /api<s>/6.1.B</s>    \n A day-ahead forecast of the total load per market time unit per bidding zone at the latest two hours before the gate closure time of the day-ahead market in the bidding zone or at D-1, 12:00 in local time zone of the bidding zone at the latest when gate closure time does not apply. The day-ahead forecast has to be updated, if there are major changes. A major change represents a change of at least 10% of the total load forecast in one market time unit. The primary owners of the data are TSOs and DSOs; \n\n The forecast of load: \n\n − is given for information purposes only. \n\n − is drawn up, among other things, on the basis of meteorological data ahead of time. It is therefore likely to change in shape and level. \n\n Note: The day-ahead forecast is calculated (estimated) on the historic load profile on similar days, taking into account the variables that affect electricity demand, such as weather conditions, climate and socioeconomic factors. \n\n <b>Example web browser get method (replace &#128071;MYTOKEN with yours)</b> \n\n <a target='_blank' href=\"https://web-api.tp.entsoe.eu/api?securityToken=MYTOKEN&documentType=A65&processType=A01&outBiddingZone_Domain=10YCZ-CEPS-----N&periodStart=201512312300&periodEnd=201612312300\">https://web-api.tp.entsoe.eu/api?securityToken=MYTOKEN&documentType=A65&processType=A01&outBiddingZone_Domain=10YCZ-CEPS-----N&periodStart=201512312300&periodEnd=201612312300</a>"
